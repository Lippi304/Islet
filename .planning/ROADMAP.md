</details>

### 🚧 v1.4 Architecture Redesign (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Redesign the `NotchPanel`/`NotchWindowController` architecture (resolving the Phase 22 drag-in blocker), then layer Droppy-inspired onboarding, a visual/material redesign, a sidebar Settings redesign, and a calendar full view on top of it. Gesture-based swipe navigation is explicitly deferred.

- [x] **Phase 23: Shell Parity Rewrite** - Rebuild NotchPanel/NotchWindowController with zero behavioral regression, dropping the residual NSDraggingDestination scaffold (completed 2026-07-11)
- [ ] **Phase 24: Drag-In** - DragApproachDetector wiring against Phase 22's already-proven pure seams
- [ ] **Phase 25: Visual/Material Theming Redesign** - Shared frosted/glossy material fill + slower default spring
- [ ] **Phase 26: Onboarding Flow** - First-launch carousel + permissions pre-explanation
- [ ] **Phase 27: Settings Sidebar Redesign** - NavigationSplitView with General/Workspace/System/About sections
- [ ] **Phase 28: Calendar Full View** - Month grid + day list + quick-add, sharing one EventKit service layer

## Phase Details

### Phase 14: Basic outfit: weather + calendar + date display with weather-driven animated background

**Goal:** The `expandedIdle` glance shows live weather (icon + temperature), date, and the next
relevant calendar event alongside the existing time readout, in a 3-column layout — with only
the weather icon animating per condition category, degrading silently to an absent column on
permission denial.
**Requirements**: WEATHER-01, CAL-01, OUTFIT-01 (new — executed ahead of the v1.1 milestone scope;
not yet in a REQUIREMENTS.md — add these 3 IDs when the next milestone's requirements are defined)
**Depends on:** Phase 13
**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Pure seams: WeatherCategory.from(_:) (D-06) + nextRelevantEvent(events:now:) (D-04), TDD
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — WeatherKit signing/entitlement setup: real Developer Team for Debug, WeatherKit App ID capability, Location/Calendar usage-description keys (Pitfall 1)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 14-01)*

- [x] 14-03-PLAN.md — Services: LocationProvider, WeatherService/WeatherKitService, CalendarService/EventKitService, BasicOutfitState

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 14-02, 14-03)*

- [x] 14-04-PLAN.md — Wire outfitState into NotchWindowController + 3-column expandedIsland layout in NotchPillView (D-07)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on 14-04)*

- [x] 14-05-PLAN.md — On-device verification: WeatherKit end-to-end, permission-denial silent omission (D-01/D-03), next-event live advancement (D-04), idle-CPU check (Pitfall 5)

## Progress

**v1.0:** 7/7 phases complete (100%) — see `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md` for the full per-phase breakdown.

**v1.0.1:** 3/3 phases complete (100%) — see `.planning/milestones/v1.0.1-ROADMAP.md` for the full per-phase breakdown.

**v1.1:** 4/4 phases complete (100%) — see `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md` for the full per-phase breakdown.

**Phase 14 (post-v1.1, pre-next-milestone):** 5/5 plans complete — completed 2026-07-08.

**v1.2:** 2/2 phases complete (100%) — see `.planning/milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md` for the full per-phase breakdown.

**v1.3:** 3/3 shipped phases complete (100%) — see `.planning/milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md`. Phase 22 (drag-in, SHELF-01/02) blocked and not shipped; carried forward into v1.4.

**v1.4:** 0/6 phases complete (0%) — Phase 23 (Shell Parity Rewrite) is first up; Phase 24 (Drag-In) has a hard dependency on Phase 23, Phases 25-28 have no shell dependency and may be resequenced for throughput.

### Phase 15: Architecture Refactor — Mechanical Fixes & DI Seams

**Goal:** Fix the audit's small, well-understood issues with no architectural risk: DRY the
duplicate frame-geometry formula (`NotchGeometry.swift`), extract a shared `blobShape()` helper
in `NotchPillView.swift`, protocolize `LocationProvider` and add its missing main-thread
contract, give `LicenseState` a dependency-injection seam, close the weather/calendar
visibility-arbiter gap, fix the `EqualizerBars` re-render bug, and preserve the real Polar.sh
validation payload instead of discarding it. Two items (EqualizerBars, Polar payload) are
explicit, called-out exceptions to an otherwise zero-product-behavior-change phase — both are
small, well-understood bug fixes with an already-worked fix.
**Requirements**: P15-ITEM1..P15-ITEM7 (source: this session's full-codebase architecture audit — no formal REQUIREMENTS.md IDs exist for this phase; the 7 CONTEXT.md scope items are the coverage unit)
**Depends on:** Phase 14
**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — NotchGeometry DRY (topPinnedFrame) + NotchPillView blobShape() extraction (items 1, 2)
- [x] 15-02-PLAN.md — LocationProvider protocolization + BasicOutfitState @MainActor + weather/calendar visibility-arbiter gap fix (items 3, 5)
- [x] 15-03-PLAN.md — LicenseState dependency-injection seam + LicenseStateTests.swift (item 4)
- [x] 15-04-PLAN.md — Preserve the real Polar.sh validation payload end-to-end (item 7)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 15-01)*

- [x] 15-05-PLAN.md — EqualizerBars re-render reshuffle bug fix (item 6)

### Phase 16: NotchWindowController Device Coordinator Extraction

**Goal:** Extract the 9-field device-splash bookkeeping (`deviceLastShown`, `deviceSuppressedAtLaunch`,
`deviceDebounce`, `connectedDeviceAddresses`, `bluetoothStartedAt`, `deviceLaunchGrace`,
`deviceBatteryWork`, `pollingAddress`, `pendingDeviceBatteryPolls`) plus `handleDevice`,
`scheduleDeviceBatteryRefresh`, and `triggerDeviceBatteryRefreshIfPromoted` out of
`NotchWindowController` into a dedicated `DeviceCoordinator` behind an `ActivityCoordinator`
protocol, with its own test surface. This is a deliberate first slice, not the full controller
split — Device is the highest-risk, most-documented case (11+ inline "gap-closure"/"Finding N"
comments recording races found after the fact), chosen to prove the coordinator shape before
repeating it for Charging/NowPlaying/Outfit in a later phase. Identical `TransientQueue`/dismiss
timing behavior; zero product-behavior change.
**Requirements**: D-01, D-02, D-03 (source: 16-CONTEXT.md locked decisions — no formal REQUIREMENTS.md IDs exist for this phase)
**Depends on:** Phase 15
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md — ActivityCoordinator protocol (D-02) + DeviceCoordinator extraction with DeviceCoordinatorTests.swift covering Pitfalls 1-8
**Wave 2** *(blocked on 16-01)*

- [x] 16-02-PLAN.md — Wire NotchWindowController to DeviceCoordinator (D-01), delete extracted fields/methods, create + execute 16-HUMAN-UAT.md's D-03 on-device Bluetooth checklist

### Phase 19: Shelf Data Model

**Goal**: The shelf's core data and lifecycle contracts exist as pure, Foundation-only, unit-tested logic — no AppKit, no drag APIs — establishing the session-only guarantee before any fragile drag/panel code is touched. Mirrors this project's own established convention (`IslandResolver` before controller wiring, `DeviceCoordinator` proven in isolation before Phase 16 wiring).
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of this milestone)
**Requirements**: SHELF-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `ShelfItem` (id, originalURL, localURL, filename, addedAt) and `ShelfLogic` (append/remove/clear/dedupe) exist as pure value types/functions, fully covered by unit tests, with no dependency on AppKit or `NSItemProvider`.
  2. The model has no persistence path whatsoever — no Codable-to-disk, no UserDefaults, no Keychain — so a cleared or relaunched shelf is provably empty by construction (SHELF-08's core contract).
  3. The shelf is designed as its own independent `@Published` axis, never a case inside `IslandResolver`/`TransientQueue` — confirmed by the model's shape alone, before any view exists.
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 19-01-PLAN.md — ShelfItem + ShelfLogic pure model (append/remove/clear/dedupe) + ShelfFileStore session-temp copy-in/delete-on-removal I/O

### Phase 20: Shelf View

**Goal**: With hand-seeded shelf state, the expanded island renders a full shelf strip — icons, per-item and delete-all removal, click-to-open, and correct gating alongside Charging/Device splashes — proving the view and panel-sizing math before any live drag risk is introduced.
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Requirements**: SHELF-03, SHELF-04, SHELF-05, SHELF-07, SHELF-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When the shelf has items and the island is expanded, a horizontally-scrolling strip appears below whatever else is showing (Now Playing, idle glance, etc.), showing each item's file-type icon, with unbounded capacity.
  2. Each shelf item has its own small trash icon; clicking it removes just that one item from the strip.
  3. A single "delete all" trash icon at the strip's far right clears every item at once.
  4. Clicking a shelf item (not its trash icon) opens the file in its default application.
  5. The shelf strip is hidden while a Charging or Device wings splash is actively showing, and reappears once the splash dismisses.
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 20-01-PLAN.md — ShelfViewState + ShelfItemView + NotchPillView shelf-aware blobShape/shelfRow, 8 previews updated, SHELF-09 resolver regression test

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 20-01)*

- [x] 20-02-PLAN.md — NotchWindowController wiring (ShelfCoordinator/ShelfViewState ownership, tap/delete/clear-all handlers, panel-height reservation, DEBUG hand-seed), ShelfViewStateTests.swift

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 20-02, gap closure)*

- [x] 20-03-PLAN.md — Closed CR-01 click-through regression: scoped syncClickThrough() hit-test to visible blob height (static panel, no resize), extracted resyncShelfViewState(animated:) helper (WR-01/WR-02)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 21: Drag-Out

**Goal**: Users can drag a file already staged in the shelf back out to Finder or any other app, using the item's own local copy — validated before the higher-risk drag-in work.
**Depends on**: Phase 20
**Requirements**: SHELF-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can drag a shelf item out of the strip onto the Finder desktop (or another app) and the real file lands there.
  2. Dragging out a shelf item whose backing file has since vanished fails gracefully (pruned or a no-op drag) rather than crashing.
  3. The expanded island's hover/grace-collapse behavior does not get stuck open after a drag-out gesture completes.
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 21-01-PLAN.md — Pure drag-gate seam (shouldBeginShelfItemDrag) + ShelfItemView .onDrag drag source + NotchWindowController drag-pin lifecycle (D-01/D-02/D-03/D-04)

### Phase 22: Drag-In

**STATUS: BLOCKED, execution aborted 2026-07-10.** Wave 3 (22-03) failed on-device twice — `NotchPanel.draggingEntered` never fired despite clean compilation and a confirmed-working 22-01 spike using the same technique. Root cause not identified. Rather than continue debugging incrementally, the user chose to redesign the underlying `NotchPanel`/`NotchWindowController` architecture in v1.4. **SHELF-01/02 carry forward as requirements into v1.4** rather than resuming this phase as planned; Wave 1-2 (22-01 spike, 22-02 pure seams) remain merged to main and reusable. See STATE.md Blockers/Concerns and `.planning/milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md` for full details. **Superseded by:** Phase 23 (shell parity rewrite) and Phase 24 (drag-in retry via a `DragApproachDetector` global-monitor pattern, replacing `NSDraggingDestination` entirely) — this phase's Wave 3 (22-03) will not be resumed as planned.

**Goal**: Users can drag a file, multiple files, or a folder onto the collapsed island and have it land in the shelf — the single highest-uncertainty integration point (click-through panel vs. drag delivery, `.mouseMoved` freezing mid-drag), spiked and sequenced last so every other piece is already proven.
**Depends on**: Phase 21
**Requirements**: SHELF-01, SHELF-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Dragging one or more files, or a folder, onto the collapsed island pill auto-expands it and each item lands in the shelf strip.
  2. While a file is being dragged over the pill before release, the drop target shows visible "hot"/targeted feedback.
  3. Dragging a file (in or out) no longer freezes the hover/collapse state machine — the island still collapses normally afterward.
  4. The click-through panel correctly receives drag events without breaking normal click-through behavior for ordinary (non-drag) pointer movement.
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 22-01-PLAN.md — On-device spike: confirm AppKit drag-destination delivery survives ignoresMouseEvents (Assumption A1), scaffold + checkpoint — PARTIAL: A1 core question confirmed (draggingEntered fires), but new blocker found (hot-zone too small/near screen-edge Mission Control trigger, drop never completes). See 22-01-SUMMARY.md and 22-RESEARCH.md Open Question 4.

**UNBLOCKED** — `/gsd:discuss-phase 22` resolved the hot-zone/Mission-Control blocker: D-02 ("reuse the existing hot-zone as-is") is superseded by D-02b (drag-accept reuses the existing expandedZone rect) + D-02c (require landing below the physical top edge, past a margin) + D-05/D-06 (auto-expand and drag-hot feedback trigger off the same wider region) + D-07 (ordinary hover/click hot-zone stays unchanged). 22-02/22-03 replanned against this (2026-07-10).

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 22-01)*

- [x] 22-02-PLAN.md — Pure seams: nextState .dragEntered event (D-01) + DragDropSupport.swift (URL extraction + D-04/non-file gate) + folder round-trip test

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 22-02)*

- [ ] 22-03-PLAN.md — NotchPanel permanent registration/forwarding + NotchWindowController drag-in handlers (D-01/D-02b/D-02c/D-03/D-04/D-05/D-06) + on-device UAT checkpoint, including the D-02b/D-02c expandedZone + landing-margin boundary check

### Phase 23: Shell Parity Rewrite

**Goal**: The notch window shell (`NotchPanel`/`NotchWindowController`) is rebuilt with behavior identical to today, clearing the one architectural prerequisite standing between the project and a working drag-in feature.
**Depends on**: Phase 21 (last shipped v1.3 phase) — Phase 22 is superseded, not resumed. Hard prerequisite for Phase 24.
**Requirements**: ARCH-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The island still positions on the built-in notch, morphs collapsed↔expanded on hover/click, and grace-collapses after ~0.4s — identical to today, verified on-device.
  2. The island still hides in true fullscreen across all 3 trigger methods (green-button, menu bar, fullscreen video) and click-through still works with no dead-zone regressions.
  3. The island still stays visible above all windows across all Spaces and correctly repositions through external-display/clamshell changes.
  4. No `NSDraggingDestination` conformance or drag-stub overrides remain in `NotchPanel.swift`.
  5. `IslandResolver.swift`, `DeviceCoordinator.swift`, and `Islet/Shelf/` show zero diff — the rewrite touched only window-shell code.
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 23-01-PLAN.md — NotchPanel.swift D-01 drag-scaffold removal + NotchPanelTests.swift regression assertion
- [x] 23-02-PLAN.md — NotchWindowController.swift reconstruction: properties/start()/monitor lifecycle + hosting-view/settings-apply/Now-Playing/shelf handlers/deinit

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 23-02, same-file sequencing)*

- [x] 23-03-PLAN.md — NotchWindowController.swift reconstruction: the safety-critical single-arbiter core (updateVisibility/positionAndShow/syncClickThrough/hover-click state machine)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 23-01, 23-03)*

- [x] 23-04-PLAN.md — Zero-diff + build gate verification, Cmd-U test suite, and the consolidated ~20-item on-device UAT checkpoint

### Phase 24: Drag-In

**Goal**: Users can drag a file, multiple files, or a folder onto the collapsed island and have it land in the shelf — retried on the reproven shell via a global-monitor detection pattern (`DragApproachDetector`) instead of `NSDraggingDestination`.
**Depends on**: Phase 23 — hard dependency; retrying drag-in before shell parity closes would repeat Phase 22's exact failure mode.
**Requirements**: SHELF-01, SHELF-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Dragging one or more files, or a folder, onto the collapsed island pill auto-expands it and each item lands in the shelf strip.
  2. While a file is being dragged over the pill before release, the drop target shows visible "hot"/targeted feedback.
  3. Drag-in works reliably across repeated on-device trials — closing the Phase 22 regression rather than repeating it.
  4. Ordinary (non-drag) hover/click/click-through behavior is unaffected by the new `DragApproachDetector`.
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 25: Visual/Material Theming Redesign

**Goal**: The collapsed pill, expanded island, and activity wings read as a physical, glossy material instead of flat black, with a slower and more deliberate default spring.
**Depends on**: None — independent of the shell work (Phases 23-24); touches `NotchPillView` rendering only, not the window shell.
**Requirements**: VISUAL-01, VISUAL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The collapsed pill, expanded island, and activity wings all render a non-fully-transparent frosted/glossy material fill from one shared material style.
  2. The default expand/collapse spring feels noticeably slower and more deliberate than today's, with no dropped frames and no visible overshoot/bounce.
  3. The material composites without visual artifacts mid-morph (collapse↔expand), verified on-device in the real never-focused panel.
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 26: Onboarding Flow

**Goal**: First-time users see a proper first-launch carousel — identity (trial/license/buy) and trust (permissions) — instead of today's passive Settings-only license flow.
**Depends on**: None — independent of the shell work; touches `AppDelegate`'s first-launch sequencing and Settings.
**Requirements**: ONBOARD-01, ONBOARD-02, ONBOARD-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. First launch shows a carousel — hero screen → trial/license-key/buy choice → permissions pre-explanation → done — replacing the existing `isFirstLaunch` → `openSettings()` branch.
  2. The permissions screen shows a one-line reason per permission (Bluetooth, Calendar, Location/WeatherKit), and its Continue/Grant action triggers the real system permission prompt for each, in sequence.
  3. The onboarding flow shows exactly once (persisted flag) and can be skipped/dismissed at any point.
  4. No gesture/feature tutorial screen appears anywhere in the flow.
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 27: Settings Sidebar Redesign

**Goal**: Settings is restructured from a single tabbed form into a sidebar-categorized layout, with every existing control preserved.
**Depends on**: None — independent of the shell work; naturally hosts Phase 25's theming controls and Phase 26's permission/license state, so sequencing after those is convenient but not required.
**Requirements**: SETTINGS-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Settings opens as a `NavigationSplitView` with sidebar sections General, Workspace (Shelf), System (Theming), and About/License.
  2. Every existing toggle (activity toggles, launch-at-login, song-change toast, fullscreen-hide, etc.) and the accent-color picker are present and functional in their new section.
  3. License and login-item state stays correctly synced when switching between sidebar sections — no stale state on section switch.
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 28: Calendar Full View

**Goal**: Users get a full calendar view — month grid, day detail, and quick-add — as a third view alongside Home and Tray, sharing one EventKit service layer with the existing glance.
**Depends on**: None — independent of the shell work; soft-pairs with Phase 27's view-switcher slot but not a hard blocker.
**Requirements**: CALVIEW-01, CALVIEW-02, CALVIEW-03, CALVIEW-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A third view (alongside Home and Tray) shows a month grid and the selected day's event list.
  2. Selecting a day with no events shows an explicit empty state, not a blank area.
  3. The user can quick-add either a calendar event or a reminder (their choice per entry) without leaving the island.
  4. The full calendar view and the existing Home-glance "next event" feature both read through one shared EventKit service layer — no duplicated date/event logic.
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
